## bug

- on reload, shiny is loading instead of the default binder or selected binder
- sometimes cards are a couple pixels off vertically which makes the tables float fucky
- applying new binder doesn't work
- last page of binder aligns to bottom instead of top
- on reload, dropdown is cleared

## todo

- finish tcg tests:
  - test_applying_drowndown
- sort by set & card number
- sort by dex
- sorting tests
- add all binder display
- standardize var and func names
- make consolidated functions for button clicks
