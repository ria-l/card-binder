## bug

- bug: on reload, shiny is loading instead of the deafult binder
- bug: sometimes cards are a couple pixels off vertically which makes the tables float fucky

## todo

- finish tcg tests:
  - test_applying_drowndown
  - subtest_loading_from_storage
- sort by set & card number
- sort by dex
- sorting tests
- add all binder display
