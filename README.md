## bug

- on reload, shiny is loading instead of the default binder or selected binder
- sometimes cards are a couple pixels off vertically which makes the tables float fucky
- applying new binder doesn't work
- last page of binder aligns to bottom instead of top
- on reload, dropdown is cleared

## todo

### v1

- finish tcg tests:
  - test_applying_drowndown
- sorting tests
- track collection progress
- make consolidated functions for button clicks

#### aesthetics

- standardize var and func names
- lock a card to the top of the screen
- scroll to newest caught card
- make the dropdown look nice

### v2

- sort by set/release & card number
- sort by dex number
- add all binder display
- add card flip functionality
- add "catch next"
