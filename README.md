## bug

- on reload, shiny is loading instead of the default binder or selected binder
- applying new binder doesn't work
- last page of binder aligns to bottom instead of top
- on reload, dropdown is cleared

## todo

- restrict pulls to binders
- show col values on page when caught
- track collection progress
- make consolidated functions for button clicks
- standardize var and func names
- sort by set/release & card number
- sort by dex number
- add all binder display
