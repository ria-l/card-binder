## bug

- last page of binder aligns to bottom instead of top
- it's possible to "catch" the header row

## todo

### both

- standardize var and func names
- use pkmn card api instead of storing cards & data locally
- nix the tests or update them
- make text nicer looking
- use document fragments
- pick a random background image
- don't use the sheet to select the default binder
- progress bar is a bit wrong; seems somewhere along the line the a filename is getting left out
- consolidate getConstantsFromStorage
- mobile-friendly

### binder

- add sorting dropdown
- add set filter
- add all binder display
- show 'only caught'
- make apply buttons & inputs more prominent
- make preset sizes into dropdowns
- list "today's catch" and jump to them
- sort by recently caught
- show recently caught
- flexbox instead of tables?

### catch

- show more col values on page when caught
- zoom when clicking on cards caught so far
- announce new catches in header
